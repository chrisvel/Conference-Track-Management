#Conference Track Management

##Solution
The First-fir decreasing algorithm has been used to solve this problem.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem

##Class explanation

* `CTParser`: Parses the data from the file given
* `CTValidator`: Validates parsed data and exports an Array with unique, valid  values
* `CTManager`: Runs the algorithm to solve the problem
* `CTPrinter`: Prints schedule to stdout

###Entity classes:
* `Talk`: Description and length for each talk
* `Track`: An array of talks and their total length for each session

##Algorithm

1. Create a new Track
2. Pick up a talk
3. If total length + talk length < time limit, append to Track, else
4. Iterate over Tracks available except current one
5. If total length + talk length < time limit, append to Track, else
6. Create a new Track
7. Append talk to new Track
8. Return to step (2)

##Usage

The program can be ran very easily:

`ruby lib/application.rb`

In my machine, it takes no time to find the solution:

```
real	0m0.157s
user	0m0.075s
sys	 0m0.061s
```

##Tests

RSpec is being used and tests are all finished successfully

Below you can find a brief description of the problem.

##Problem : Conference Track Management

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

*  The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
*  Each session contains multiple talks.
*  Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
*  Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
*  The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
*  No talk title has numbers in it.
*  All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
*  Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.
